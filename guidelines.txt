<:news:834457524886569010> **Bumping & Duplicates**
In order to avoid losing suggestions and issues, they can be bumped. Posts may be bumped if it has been 2 weeks since their latest bump with no response from developers. Before bumping a post, you must search for duplicates with Discord's search feature (CTRL+F or ⌘+F). Once you've reached 7 duplicates, you will be muted temporarily. After 7, actions taken are chosen on a case by case basis.

If you are unsure of whether your suggestion or issue is a duplicate, feel free to ask in <#832858384717578241>.
